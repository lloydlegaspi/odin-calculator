# Calculator Project - The Odin Project: Foundations Course

## Introduction
This project is a simple on-screen calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course, which aims to solidify your understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

This project combines the skills you've learned throughout the course, including JavaScript functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation. The goal is to create a fully functional, user-friendly calculator interface that can handle multiple operations and provide accurate results.

## Features
The calculator has the following core functionalities:
- Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Chained Calculations: Automatically computes the result of a previous operation when a new operator is pressed.
- History Display: Shows the full input history on the screen, allowing users to see the operation sequence.
- Clear Button (AC): Resets the display and history.
- Delete Button (DEL): Deletes the last entered character.
- Floating Point Numbers: Allows users to input and calculate decimal numbers, ensuring no multiple decimal points are entered (e.g., 12.3.56 is invalid).
- Error Handling: Displays an error message when dividing by zero and prevents calculator crashes.
